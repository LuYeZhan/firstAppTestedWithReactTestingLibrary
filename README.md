# Project Name

React TDD app

## Description

This is an app to learn TDD using React testing library.
 
## User Stories

- **homepage** 

Once you are on the homepage, you can see a To-dos list, without any todo.

- You can create new todos by writing in the input bar anything you want. You create it when you press "enter".

- There's a check box above any todo's. If you check the checkbox, that means your todo is done, and will be showed onto the done category.

- In all you can see all the todos.

- In active you can see all the todos that are not checked, meaning they are active and prior to be done.

- Next to each todo you can remove it by pressing on the remove button.

## Main learnings and struggles
